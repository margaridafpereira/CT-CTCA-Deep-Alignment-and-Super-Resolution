# CT-CTCA-Deep-Alignment-and-Super-Resolution
CT/CTCA alignment and super-resolution frameworks

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading global cause of mortality, characterized by plaque buildup in coronary arteries that restricts blood flow and can lead to myocardial infarction. Current diagnostic methods begin with initial Computed Tomography (CT) scans to detect calcifications, followed by higher-resolution CT Coronary Angiography (CTCA) with contrast to visualize blood flow and identify stenosis. Combining these scans could provide additional insights, but is hindered by slice misalignments due to patient motion between exams and differing axial resolutions, with CT scans having a 1.5 mm slice thickness and CTCA ranging from 0.4 mm to 1 mm. Therefore, developing frameworks for Super Resolution (SR) and alignment of CT and CTCA images is crucial for advancing cardiovascular disease diagnosis. While deep learning (DL) techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown success in SR, there remains a research gap specifically in axial SR applied to cardiac CT.
As such, this work aims to develop automatic and robust tools for the alignment and super-resolution of the CT and CTCA exams. This will allow future efforts towards multi-modality CAD classification, image generation and others.
